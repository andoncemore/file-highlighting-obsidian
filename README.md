## File-Highlighting Obsidian Plugin

File-Highlighting is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md)

This plugin lets you define a set of tags and associated colors which are used to highlight references to files that have those tags. 

This can be used to give visual clarity to the different "types" of notes you have in obsidian, as defined by the tags you choose to use. 

**Note:** This is all very hacked together, so there may be bugs and certain workflows that do not work


### Features

* Define a custom set of tags and associated colors in the plugin settings
* Preview mode links are highlighted, and update when changes are made
* Preview mode links include custom classes, based on tag name, allowing you to write custom css to target those links

#### Future work
* Highlighting of Markdown editor links
